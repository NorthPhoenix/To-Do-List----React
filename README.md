# To-Do-List----React

My first ever web app built with React and TailwindCSS!!

Not an original idea, but **NO WALKTHROUGH** was used. All work is my own.

Supports dark mode.

## How To Run

To run the project, clone the repo with
```
git clone https://github.com/NorthPhoenix/To-Do-List----React.git
```
Next, go into the project, download dependencies, and start a development server
```
cd To-Do-List----React
```
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
